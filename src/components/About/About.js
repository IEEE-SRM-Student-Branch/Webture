            chapter and multitude of the scholarly that aims in advancing
            technology for Humanity reminds the technology community and the
            world that IEEE stands at the forefront of technological change for
            the betterment of humanity. No matter how advanced technology gets,
            there will always be a divide keeping us from truly knowing a few
